# Classic Arcade Game Clone

This game is a clone of the classic game Frogger. In it, you attempt to cross the walkway to reach the water, while avoiding being hit by the large, speedy bugs whizzing by.

## Getting Started
### What You'll Need
You'll need a Web browser, which you obviously already have.

### Running the game
To run the game:
1. Download the .zip file
2. Unzip the files
3. Point your browser to the index.html file

## How To Play
Your objective is to get across the walkway and to the water on the other side.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate up, down, and side-to-side. If you hit a bug, you'll be knocked back to where you started. When you reach the water you'll move back to the beginning and the difficulty will increase.
