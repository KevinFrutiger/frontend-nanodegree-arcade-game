# Classic Arcade Game Clone

<a href="http://kevinfrutiger.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/" target="_blank">View the live game</a>

This was the third project in the _Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree_. The objective was to edit an existing game engine to add player and enemy entities using JavaScript's psuedo-classical object-oriented style.

## Getting Started

This game is a clone of the classic game _Frogger_. In it, you attempt to cross the walkway to reach the water, while avoiding being hit by the large, speedy bugs whizzing by.

### What You'll Need

A Web browser.

### Running the Game

You can run the game <a href="http://kevinfrutiger.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Alternatively, to run the game locally:

1. Download the .zip file using the **Download ZIP** button located in the GitHub sidebar (or clone the repository)
2. Unzip the file
3. Point your browser to **index.html** in the **src** folder of the files that you just unzipped

## How to Play

Your objective is to get across the walkway and to the water on the other side.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate up, down, and side-to-side. If you hit a bug, you'll be knocked back to where you started. When you reach the water you'll return to the bottom of the screen and the difficulty will increase. Collect gems and hearts to get more points!
