# Classic Arcade Game Clone

This game is a clone of the classic game _Frogger_. In it, you attempt to cross the walkway to reach the water, while avoiding being hit by the large, speedy bugs whizzing by.

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

A Web browser.

### Running the Game

To run the game:

1. Download the .zip file using the **Download ZIP** button located in the GitHub sidebar
2. Unzip the file
3. Point your browser to index.html in the files that you just unzipped

## How to Play

Your objective is to get across the walkway and to the water on the other side.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate up, down, and side-to-side. If you hit a bug, you'll be knocked back to where you started. When you reach the water you'll return to the bottom of the screen and the difficulty will increase. Collect gems and hearts to get more points!
